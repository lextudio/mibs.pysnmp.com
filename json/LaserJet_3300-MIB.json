Additional information: Behaves as COPIER-CONTRAST and SCANNER-CONTRAST. Contrast values can range from -127 to +127, for a total of 255 contrast values. Within that range, LaserJet 3300 supports 11 values. They are: -125, -100, -75, -50, -25, 0, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125. The default contrast level is 0 (normal). A positive value results in a larger difference, and a negative value results in a smaller difference. LaserJet 3300 snaps unsupported values toward zero as follows: \u003c=-125 snaps to -125 \u003e-125 and \u003c=-100 snaps to -100 \u003e-100 and \u003c=-75 snaps to -75 \u003e-75 and \u003c=-50 snaps to -50 \u003e-50 and \u003c=-25 snaps to -25 \u003e-25 and \u003c25 snaps to 0 \u003e=25 and \u003c50 snaps to 25 \u003e=50 and \u003c75 snaps to 50 \u003e=75 and \u003c100 snaps to 75 \u003e=100 and \u003c125 snaps to 100 \u003e=125 snaps to 125",

If a call picked up at the phone turns out to be a fax call, the user may initiate a fax receive via the fax machine front panel (with, say, a button press). When this object is set to eEnabled and a fax call is answered at the phone, the user has the option of initiating the fax receive in the usual way at the fax front panel or by entering a (product-specific) key sequence on the telephone keypad (e.g. \u0027***\u0027). The device POS must indicate what the key sequence is for a particular product. When this object is set to eDisabled and a fax call is answered at the phone, the user may only initiate the fax receive by taking the product-specific action (such as a button press) at the fax machine front panel. It is necessary to be able to turn this feature off (i.e. set it to eDisabled) because the key sequence of a particular fax device may interfere with other devices connected to the phone line (e.g. an answering machine). Additional information: On LaserJet 3300, the key sequence to initiate a fax from the phone keypad is \u0027***\u0027.",

Examples of computing x_res and y_res: 300 dots/inch:round(300 * 65536) = 19660800 16 dots/mm: round(16 * 25.4 * 65536) = 26633830. If the device does not support the given combination, then it\u0027ll select the nearest supported values in a device-dependent manner (documented in the POS). Additional information: LaserJet 3300 supports 4 fax resolutions. As far as the end-user is concerned these resolutions are: standard, fine, superfine, and photo. Photo is not really a resolution--see more below. Standard is the default. Resolutions map as follows (values are given in dots per inch (dpi) horizontal X vertical (x X y)): standard(203 X 98), fine(203 X 196), superfine(300 X 300), and photo(300 X 300). Supported resolutions in hex notation (dpi, x X y) are: standard(00cb0000 X 00620000), fine(00cb0000 X 00c4000), superfine(012C0000 X 012C0000), and photo(012C0000 X 012C0000). The device ignores attempts to set invalid resolutions. Photo is not a resolution, but photo setting depends on whether half-toning is on or off. In the case of LaserJet 3300 photo setting doesn\u0027t actually change the bits going out the modem -- still one bit per pixel so photo and superfine are the same. NOTE: The last 16 bits of the horizontal and vertical settings are ignored. Only the first 16 bits of the horizontal and vertical resolution setting are used.",

An application capable of using a specific PrtChannelType should be able to use the combined information from the prtChannelInformation and other channel and interface group objects to \u0027bootstrap\u0027 its use of the channel. prtChannelInformation is not intended to provide a general channel description, nor to provide information that is available once the channel is in use. The encoding and interpretation of the prtChannelInformation object is specific to channel type. The description of each PrtChannelType enum value for which prtChannelInformation is defined specifies the appropriate encoding and interpretation, including interaction with other objects. For channel types that do not specify a prtChannelInformation value, its value shall be null (0 length). When a new PrtChannelType enumeration value is registered, its accompanying description must specify the encoding and interpretation of the prtChannelInformation value for the channel type. prtChannelInformation semantics for an existing PrtChannelType may be added or amended in the same manner as described in section 2.4.1 for type 2 enumeration values. The prtChannelInformation specifies values for a collection of channel attributes, represented as text according to the following rules: 1. The prtChannelInformation is coded in the NVT ASCII character set. It is not affected by localization. 2. The prtChannelInformation is a list of entries representing the attribute values. Each entry consists of the following items, in order: a. a keyword, composed of alphabetic characters (A-Z, a-z), that identifies a channel attribute, b. an Equals Sign (=) to delimit the keyword, c. a data value, consisting of NVT ASCII graphics characters (codes 32-126), d. a Line Feed character (code 10) to delimit the data value. No other characters shall be present. Keywords are case-sensitive. Conventionally, keywords are capitalized (including each word of a multi-word keyword), and, since they occupy space in the prtChannelInformation, they are kept short. 3. If a channel attribute has multiple values, it is represented by multiple entries with the same keyword, each specifying one value. Otherwise, there shall be at most one entry for each attribute. 4. By default, entries may appear in any order. If there are ordering constraints for particular entries, these must be specified in their definitions. 5. The prtChannelInformation value may represent information that is not normally coded in textual form, or that is coded in a character set other than NVT ASCII. In these cases, whatever symbolic representation is conventionally used for the information should be used for encoding the prtChannelInformation. (For instance, a binary port value might be represented as a decimal number, Unicode would be represented in UTF-8 format.) 6. For each PrtChannelType for which prtChannelInformation entries are defined, the descriptive text associated with the PrtChannelType enumeration value shall specify the following information for each entry: Title: Brief description phrase, e.g.: \u0027Port name\u0027, \u0027Service Name\u0027, Keyword: The keyword value, eg: \u0027Port\u0027, \u0027Service\u0027 Syntax: The encoding of the entry value, if it cannot be directly represented by NVT ASCII, Status: \u0027Mandatory\u0027, \u0027Optional\u0027, or \u0027Conditionally Mandatory\u0027, Multiplicity: \u0027Single\u0027 or \u0027Multiple\u0027, to indicate whether the entry may be present multiple times, Description: Description of the use of the entry, other information required to complete the definition (e.g.: ordering contstraints, interactions between entries). Applications that interpret prtChannelInformation should ignore unrecognized entries, so they are not affected if new entry types are added.",

When read, this object will always have the value `notResetting(3)\u0027, and a SET of the value `notResetting\u0027 shall have no effect on the printer. Some of the defined values are optional. However, every implementation must support at least the values `notResetting\u0027 and \u0027resetToNVRAM\u0027. Additional information: The LaserJet 3300 supports the values \u0027notResetting\u0027, \u0027resetToNVRAM\u0027 and \u0027resetToFactoryDefaults. Setting this object to ePnotResetting causes the printer to do no reset. Setting this object to ePpowerCycleReset causes this device to do a reset. Setting this object to \u0027resetToNVRAM\u0027 does NOT perform an NVRAM init on the LaserJet 3300 Series product. It causes the LaserJet 3300 products to perform its power on initialization routines. All I/O buffers are reset and tests normally run at power on time are executed. Setting the object to \u0027resetToFactoryDefaults, causes the device to perform its reset to factory defaults routines. Also, the device will perform a power cycle, which is required to set all variables to their factory defaults.",

If the printer is not idle (whether printing an external job, printing an internal page or running self test), a status of \u003cgenErr\u003e status will be returned with a value of eNotInASelfTest. When the printer is idle, setting this object to eNonDestructiveSelfTest causes the configuration page to be formatted and put in the printer\u0027s print queue. Attempting to set this object before the configuration page has completed being formatted and printed will cause \u003cgenErr\u003e status to be returned with a value of eNotInASelfTest. After the configuration page is in the queue, a get on this object will return a value of eNotInASelfTest. Setting the value to eNotInASelfTest is not supported on the LaserJet 3300 product. Once the test has started, it will finish printing. Likewise, if the PRINT-INTERNAL-PAGE object is set to a valid value and that page has not printed when this object is set to eNonDestructiveSelfTest, a status of \u003cgenErr\u003e status with a value of eNotInASelfTest will be returned until the internal page has printed.",
